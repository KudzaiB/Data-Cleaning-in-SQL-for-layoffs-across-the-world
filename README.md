**Summary**

This project explores global layoff trends, using data cleaning techniques in SQL to refine raw information and build an analytical foundation for understanding the shifting dynamics of data professionals. Before diving into insights, the first step was ensuring data accuracy. Like any dataset, the raw layoff data contained inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values challenges that could distort the final analysis.

Using SQL, I conducted a thorough data cleaning process:

✅Removed duplicate records to avoid inflated numbers.
✅Standardised country names and company information for consistency.
✅Handled missing values to ensure every data point contributed meaningfully.

Industries reacted differently to market shifts. While some adapted through digital transformation, others struggled to survive.
