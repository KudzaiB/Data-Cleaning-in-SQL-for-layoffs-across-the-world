**Summary**

This project explores global layoff trends, using data cleaning techniques in SQL to refine raw information and build an analytical foundation for understanding the shifting dynamics of data professionals. Before diving into insights, the first step was ensuring data accuracy. Like any dataset, the raw layoff data contained inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values challenges that could distort the final analysis.

**Using SQL, I conducted a thorough data cleaning process:**

âœ…Removed duplicate records to avoid inflated numbers.

âœ…Standardised country names and company information for consistency.

âœ…Handled missing values to ensure every data point contributed meaningfully.

**Industries reacted differently to market shifts. While some adapted through digital transformation, others struggled to survive.**

ðŸŽ¯Tech Industry: Companies that hired aggressively during the digital boom faced massive layoffs when demand slowed down.

ðŸŽ¯Retail & Manufacturing: Workforce reductions followed shifts toward e-commerce and automation.

ðŸŽ¯Finance & Startups: Venture capital slowdowns meant many startups had to cut costs by reducing staff.

**Findings:**

âœ… The United States led in layoffs, followed by other economically developed nations where major corporations underwent restructuring.

âœ… Tech companies dominated the layoffs, showing a trend of over hiring during rapid expansion phases and then cutting back when economic conditions shifted.

âœ… Economic recessions, automation, and business restructuring were the primary drivers behind workforce reductions.
